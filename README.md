# 1_Siemens__1_Ohm
Technical Challenge

Siemens | inv(Ohm) = 1 Siemens :)

## IMPORTANT: The technical challenge lies with the Branch MASTER!
## Observations:
- Some challenges are coded in java (e.g. Technical Challenge*.java) and
also with a version in a MAIN method to evaluate, also, proficiency in C/C++ (e.g. mainTechChallenge*.c).

- The BQ utility was coded in *.sh files similar to shell/linux programming.
